# Lab-Project

Many people with different fields of education use the LinkedIn platform in order to find a job, improve their knowledge and connect with people with common professional interests.

Today LinkedIn does not offer practical professional development such as courses in the relevant educational fields.

Our project will deal with adapting courses to LinkedIn users based on their education.

Our system will allow:
1. Professional development in that the user will be able to find courses that are relevant to him easily

2. Improving efficiency - instead of the user spending a lot of time searching for courses, the system will automatically recommend them

3. Improving the LinkedIn user experience - adding another feature to the system


In addition, adding the feature has a business advantage for LinkedIn in that they will be able to collaborate with sites that offer courses (for example Coursera) and charge a fee for it
